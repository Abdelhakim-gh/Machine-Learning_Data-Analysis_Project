# Machine Learning & Data Analysis Projects

> **Abdelhakim EL Ghayoubi** 

- This is a project I worked on to apply the things I learned.
- I've provided both code and documentation for both projects, as well as a summary for languages `Python` & `R`.
- Data sets are also provided, make sure to analyze them thoroughly.

### Machine Learning Project with `Python`

- This project focuses on recognizing handwritten numbers (digits) using machine learning algorithms. Handwritten digits vary significantly in terms of writing style, size, and orientation.
- The objective is to develop a machine learning model capable of accurately identifying handwritten digits. This model should be trained on a dataset containing different representations of numbers in the form of image grids. Once trained, the model should be able to predict the digit in unseen images with high accuracy.

### Data Analysis Projects with `R`

- This project focuses on comparing the Life Expectancy vs. Fertility in 1960 & 2013 of regions to highlight the regions with stable & high quality of life or maybe predict the potential growing/developed region.


### Tools used: 

- Jupyter note book 
- R studio 
- Python & R (last versions)
